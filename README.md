# Requirements

## Node

## Gulp

Gulp is a task runner built on Node.js and npm, used for automation of time-consuming and repetitive tasks involved in web development like minification, concatenation, cache busting, unit testing, linting, optimization, etc.

You need to install it locally.

# Theme

## Installation

### Dependencies

At the root of the theme, you need to install the dependencies with npm

```
npm install
```

At the end of this process, you should have a node_modules folder in your theme.

Then, you have to copy all needed dependency assets files from node_modules (bootstrap for example).

```
gulp copy-assets
```

At the end of this process, the dependencies define in the task 'copy-assets' should be copied in the assets/libs folder.

```
theme
└───assets
│   └───libs
│       └───js
│         └───bootstrap4
│           │   bootstrap.bundle.js
│           │   bootstrap.bundle.min.js
